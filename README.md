Hi, I’m JP O'Brien.
I’m interested in Statistical/Machine Learning, especially decision forests.
I'm currently trying to pick up more traditional CS skills in order to become a more effective Data Scientist. 
this github is still very much a work in progress.
You can reach me at: johnobrien@ucsb.edu or jpobrien925@gmail.com
